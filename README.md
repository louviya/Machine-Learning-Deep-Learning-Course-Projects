# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Sequential-Data-Classification





•	Built the models in Python with the TensorFlow backend to classify multi-classes and multi- label data. The models include NN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, RF(binary relevance, classifier chain, power set, MLKNN).


•	Improved performance for each kind of model based on the same data by measuring the classification accuracy, confusion matrix, f1 scores, recalls, precision, etc.
