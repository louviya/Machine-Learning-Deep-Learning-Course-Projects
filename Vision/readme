Project #1
Part 1: Camera calibration using linear method (50pts)
 Implement the conventional camera calibration method introduced in class – estimating camera parameters from the projection matrix 
using 2D-3D correspondence either in c++ or matlab.
 Perform experiments on a given data set and estimate the calibration performance in terms of projection error.
Part 2: Robust camera calibration (50pts)
As introduced in class, we can use the RANSAC method when there are outliers in the data.
 Implement the RANSAC method and perform experiments on the given data set and estimate the calibration performance in terms of 
projection error.

Project #2
extract 3D information of a human face from its 2 images taken from two different views. 28 facial landmarks are detected and are 
superimposed on each image. The project includes the following tasks:
1. Compute the intrinsic parameters W of both cameras respectively using the calibration data attached and the camera calibration 
procedure you developed for last project. 
2. Manually establish correspondences between the marked facial landmarks between the two images. To avoid all points being co-planar, 
you may need to select additional unmarked facial feature points from two images and match them. Indicate what other facial landmarks 
you select. Given the matched points, use the 8-point method to compute the fundamental matrix F, and then the essential matrix E. 
Note E is only up to a scale factor.
3. Derive the relative orientation and translation R and T of the two cameras based on the absolute orientation computed for each 
camera from step 1.
4. Produce the rectified left and right images using the rectification procedure introduced in the lecture notes. Write down the 
rectification process, display the rectified images, and verify the results.
